# d3.js-playground

These are my first two attempts at using D3.js. I followed a tutorial for each of the projects and learned many new concepts in the process.

### D3 Election
Thank you to [Josh Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05nmVWe14c) for the tutorial on displaying election results using D3.js.

### Simple Pie Chart
Thank you to [Karthik Thota](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK5kKA-0PUQ&t=1105s) for the introduction of D3.js using a simple pie chart to display information from a csv file.
